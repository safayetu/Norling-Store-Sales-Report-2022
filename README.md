Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (pivot tables, charts, conditional formatting, VLOOKUP, formulas like SUMIF and COUNTIF); optional: Power Query for data import if advanced.
Data Source: Simulated/real sales transactions dataset (e.g., 10,000+ rows with columns: Order ID, Date, Gender, Age, State, Channel, Category, Amount, Status).
Objectives

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values (e.g., filled blanks with averages), and standardized formats (e.g., dates to MM/DD/YYYY).
Analysis Techniques: Used pivot tables for aggregations (e.g., sum by gender, state), charts for comparisons, and formulas for calculations (e.g., percentage contributions).
Visualization: Created dashboards with combo charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps for intuitive insights.
